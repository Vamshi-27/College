		<p> Environmental issues focus on the impact of human activities on the planet, particularly climate change, sustainability, and eco-friendly practices. Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, 
leads to rising temperatures and extreme weather patterns. Sustainability aims to balance resource use with long-term environmental health, encouraging practices like recycling, renewable energy, and conservation. Eco-friendly practices promote reducing waste, conserving water, and adopting green technologies to protect natural ecosystems for future generations.The environment is the natural world that surrounds us, consisting of air, water, land, and ecosystems that support life. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance necessary for the survival of plants, animals, and humans. However, human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and overconsumption of resources have caused significant harm to the environment, leading to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and the depletion of natural resources. It is vital that we recognize the importance of sustainable practices, conservation efforts, and environmental protection to preserve the planet for future generations and ensure a healthy, thriving world.</p>
